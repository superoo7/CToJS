## Background
I was inspired by a video done by google. The speaker used a certain "recipe" which is basically connected Arduino to the internet.

She uses [FireBase](https://firebase.google.com) as a NoSQL database.

When I go in-depth learning node.js, I realised it is capable to do tonnes of powerful programming stuff.
Therefore, I want to give it a try to convert my C in arduino -> node.js

## Requirement
* basic C/C++ on Arduino
* basic microcontroller knowledge
* basic JS, node.js
* with terminal command (Shell/Bash)

## Materials
* Arduino UNO
* Cable
* Raspberry Pi 3

## Intergrated Development Environment (IDE) used
* platform.io for C/C++ in arduino (complicated)
* Arduino IDE for basic arduino
* Vim in iTerm (editting in JS)

## Library used
* [Firmata](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/firmata)
* [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io)
